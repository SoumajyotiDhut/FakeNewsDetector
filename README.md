# üì∞ Fake News Detector

## üß† Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based web application that detects whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real**. It also displays a **confidence score** for the prediction and highlights the **top keywords** that influenced the decision.

---

## üîç Project Description

This application leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify news articles. It features a clean, responsive **Flask web interface** built with **Bootstrap 5**.

### üìå Key Features

- üåê **Flask-based web interface**: A user-friendly and interactive online platform.
- üîç **Real-time prediction with confidence score**: Get instant results with an indication of how certain the model is.
- üß† **Random Forest classifier**: Utilizes a robust machine learning algorithm, achieving approximately **99% accuracy**.
- üßæ **Highlights important TF-IDF keywords**: Understand which words are most influential in the fake/real news classification.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Clean, modular folder structure**: Easy to navigate and maintain the codebase.
